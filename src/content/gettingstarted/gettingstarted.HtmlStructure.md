title: Structure of your qWidget
---

When starting to work with the qWidget concept you'll soon realize that there is nothing special to know.
Basically you can just use standard Html and paste it into the Html-Editor and you'll immediately see the results.

It certainly makes sense (if you are not that familiar with Html) to copy & paste 
existing code (which can be found on thousands of brilliant websites) and then modify it.

## Use you own Html-Editor
Certainly it also absolutely makes sense if you are using a local Html-Editor, prepare your Html- and CSS-structure there and then paste it just to the qWidget-Editors.

## One Advice
When designing your qWidgets, **do not use IDs but classes instead**, otherwise it can happen that you'll recognize unwanted results if you are using multiple instances of the same qWidget.
