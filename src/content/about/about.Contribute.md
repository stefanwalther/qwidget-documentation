**Great! You are interested in contributing to this project?!**
There are several ways how you can do that (ranked by priority):


## Test and Use the Prototype
First of all, please don't believe me!

* Are there any logical limitations in the concept of qWidgets I didn't think of?
* Are there any functionalities which would be absolutely necessary to bring more value into the concept of qWidgets?
* Are there any competitors offering similar capabilities?

Please help me, use existing qWidgets, create your own qWidgets, evaluate the concept and let me know!

## Create & Publish (!!!) qWidgets
My very, very ambitious goal is to have at least 200 qWidgets until GA of QlikView.Next in autumn 2014.
The real power behind this concept IMHO is that you could select from a list of hundreds of existing visualizations, completely independent from the app, the data-model or the current environment.

**Wouldn't it be nice if we could all select from a list of hundreds visualizations?**

There are several ways to "publish" a qWidget:
- Use the "Publish" functionality within the extension (preferred)
- Export the qWidget to a .zip-file ("Export" in the WidgetEditor) and [send it to me](https://eu1.salesforce.com/_ui/core/chatter/groups/GroupProfilePage?g=0F9D0000000LN9X)
- Just [send me the code](https://eu1.salesforce.com/_ui/core/chatter/groups/GroupProfilePage?g=0F9D0000000LN9X)


## Provide Feedback
[Send me your feedback](https://eu1.salesforce.com/_ui/core/chatter/groups/GroupProfilePage?g=0F9D0000000LN9X), your ideas, thoughts and criticism! Please!


## Improve Documentation
We all know this: The best solution sucks if the documentation cannot tell you what is possible with a certain piece of software. This certainly also applies to the concept of qWidget.
So I am happy if you can help me, [send me](https://eu1.salesforce.com/_ui/core/chatter/groups/GroupProfilePage?g=0F9D0000000LN9X) your suggestions, criticism, code-examples, whatever ...


## Help Developing qWidget 1.0, 2.0 ...
Nothing is more frustrating than to code on a project without the possibility to exchange with other developers. So I am more than happy if you want to help to improve the code-base of qWidget.
Maybe this is a good opportunity for you to improve your QlikView-extension-development skills?
Everything is set up to support a multi-developer experience and this would be great.

So if you are familiar with at least *some the below listed technologies* and if you want/can spend some time for this project, contact me!


* Developing Extensions in QliView 11 or QlikView.Next
	* CSS
	* JavaScript
	* AngularJS
* Asp.Net Web API (Backend) or Asp.net MVC (Backend User Interface)
