**Great! You are interested in contributing to this project?!**


## Test and Use the Prototype
First of all, please don't believe me!

* Are there any logical limitations in the concept of qWidgets I didn't think of?
* Are there any functionalities which would be absolutely necessary to bring more value into the concept of qWidgets?
* Are there any competitors offering similar capabilities?

Please help me, use existing qWidgets, create your own qWidgets, evaluate the concept and let me know!  
[Provide your feedback](http://community.qlik.com/community/qlikview_beta_programs/qwidget_limited_public_beta), your ideas, thoughts and criticism! Please!

## Create & Publish qWidgets
The very, very ambitious goal is to have at least 200 qWidgets available in the qWidget repository as soon as possible.
The real power behind this concept really is, that you could select from a list of hundreds of existing visualizations, completely independent from the app, the data-model or the current environment.

**Wouldn't it be nice if we could all select from a list of hundreds visualizations?**

There are several ways to "publish" a qWidget:
- Use the "Publish" functionality within the extension (preferred)
- Export the qWidget to a .zip-file ("Export" in the WidgetEditor) and publish it on the [qWidget section on Qlik Community](http://community.qlik.com/community/qlikview_beta_programs/qwidget_limited_public_beta)
(Note: The export functionality has been temporarily disabled for version 0.20.x)
